 

The {prosemirror-commands} module provides a number of editing commands, from simple ones such as a variant of the {deleteSelection} command, to rather complicated ones such as {joinBackward}, which implements the block-joining behavior that should happen when you press backspace at the start of a textblock. It also comes with a [basic keymap](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.baseKeymap) that binds a number of schema-agnostic commands to the keys that are usually used for them.

When possible, different behavior, even when usually bound to a single key, is put in different commands. The utility function {chainCommands} can be used to combine a number of commandsâ€”they will be tried one after the other until one return true.
