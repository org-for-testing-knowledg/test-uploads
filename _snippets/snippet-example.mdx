Favorite hobby: **rewriting third-party React libraries in pure CSS to create a banger**. Todayâ€™s example: **react-slick** (a 15kB image gallery) was causing multiple style recalcs for a client. But fret not, I **made it a banger** by replacing it with a **20-line almost-pure-CSS implementation with scroll snapping**. Who needs those style recalcs when you can have a smooth, efficient, and stylish solution?
