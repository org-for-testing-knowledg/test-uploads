 

The `prosemirror-commands` module offers various editing commands, ranging from simple ones like a variation of the `deleteSelection` command, to more complex commands like {joinBackward}, which

hich implements the block-joining behavior that should happen when you press backspace at the start of a textblock. It also comes with a [basic keymap](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.baseKeymap) that binds a number of schema-agnostic commands to the keys that are usually used for them.

When possible, different behavior, even when usually bound to a single key, is put in different commands. The utility function {chainCommands} can be used to combine a number of commandsâ€”they will be tried one after the other until one return true.
